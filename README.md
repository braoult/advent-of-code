#### My solutions to the [advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

My solutions to the 2 daily exercises in both C and Bash (also Cobol for day 1, I may try some other languages).

#### My own rules:
 - **C** : Only *standard* libraries (for example, no external sort).
 - **bash**: Pure bash only: No external commands allowed (grep, sed, etc...).

#### Done:
 -  Day  1:     Bash, C, and Cobol
 -  Days 2-18:  Bash and C
 -  Days 19-22: Bash
