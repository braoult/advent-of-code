#### My solutions to the [2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019), [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) and [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), in C and Bash.

#### My own rules :
 - **C** : Only *standard* libraries (for example, no external sort). However, I may use my *own* includes and libraries.
 - **bash**: Pure bash only: No external commands allowed (grep, sed, awk, etc...).

#### Advent of Code 2019
 - `C`: Days 1-9

#### Advent of Code 2020
 - `C`: Days 1-19, 23-25
 - `Bash`: All (days 1-25)
 - `Cobol`: Day 1 (!!)

#### Advent of Code 2021
 - `C`: All (days 1-25)
